    "# TV Script Generation\n",
    "In this project, you'll generate your own [Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons) TV scripts using RNNs.  You'll be using part of the [Simpsons dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data) of scripts from 27 seasons.  The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at [Moe's Tavern](https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Moe's_Tavern).\n",
